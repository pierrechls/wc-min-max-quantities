# Min/Max Quantities
> Specify minimum and maximum allowed product quantities for orders to be completed. [https://woocommerce.com/products/minmax-quantities/](https://woocommerce.com/products/minmax-quantities/)

This neat little extension allows you to define minimum/maximum thresholds and multiple/group amounts per product (including variations) to restrict the quantities of items which can be purchased. The Min/Max Quantities extension lets you set up quantity rules for :

- Orders
	- Set a minimum and maximum quantity required to checkout
	- Set a minimum and maximum cost (of cart items) required to checkout
	- Exclude products from said rules
- Products
	- Minimum and maximum quantity required
	- Group/multiples required (e.g. you must purchase in groups of X)
	- Per-variation control of the above product rules

The customer wonâ€™t be able to checkout until they meet your restrictions â€“ errors will be shown on their cart page and prompt them to correct their cart items.
